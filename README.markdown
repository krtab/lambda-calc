#LambdaCalc

Lambdacalc aims at becoming a powerfull tool for lambda calculus, in a far far away future. Right now, it's just me having fun in ocaml.

If you want to use it, the common `make` should be enough, provided you have ocaml installed.

If you want to rebuild lexer and parser (using menhir and ocamllex), do Ì€make parlex`.

You should use cli (the final binary) with rlwrap. ;)
